#summary To do list for initial development.


= Customization =

  * load new settings from a url and save them in the database
  * list of "official" urls to get versions from

= Score reporting =

  * url to check if a score is a high score
  * url to submit a high score with comment and all that jazz, similar to existing setup
  * dealer of the day and other superlatives
  * broadening of "score"

= More end-of-game statistics =

  * total units moved
  * total cops killed
  * date loan paid off

= Resume in-progress game =

  * need to save the game type with current game info (need this for score reporting anyway)
  * then just check game type against the available types on the main menu and make a tap on that resume (hold to erase), pretty simple

= User-created data =

  * song entry
  * saying entry
  * maybe these could happen at random points during the game instead of at the end, and be buttons so you can skip 'em if you don't want them
  * responses to user messages? this would require some server work, like a token and stuff, but would be uber-cool

= Graphics =

  * make some less preliminary versions?
  * backgrounds?
  * background flipping

= Fight vs. Drug messages =

  * split into two classes so the drug messages don't show up during a fight

= Death =

  * little details, forgot about this, shouldn't be too hard just during a fight only show end game and do end game as usual

= Make messages disapear when tapped =

  * pretty easy, low priority until they popup

= Popup video messages =

  * message will need x/y, what about size, maybe low priority this one too?

= Scrollable container for buttons =

  * not so important for g1 yet, but could be with more drugs.
  * complicated ui things, scroll containers look tricky.

= Customizable UI (thinking about other phones =

  * let game info resize text and buttons so other phone ui's can be tweaked as necessary

= Code cleanup =

  * subfunctionize the makebutton code more
  * comments a-plenty
