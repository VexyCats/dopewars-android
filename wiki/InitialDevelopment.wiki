#summary To do list for initial development.

= TODO's =
  * DopeWars (8)
  * DopeWarsGame (85)
  * GameInformation (6)

= Score reporting =

  * url to check if a score is a high score
  * url to submit a high score with comment and all that jazz, similar to existing setup
  * dealer of the day and other superlatives
  * broadening of "score"

= User-created data =

  * song entry
  * saying entry
  * responses to user messages? this would require some server work, like a token and stuff, but would be uber-cool

= Graphics =

  * make some less preliminary versions?
  * backgrounds?
  * background flipping

= Known Bugs =

  * End game doesn't clear the current game (maybe have two end buttons, one with saving?)
  * Sometimes the cops message doesn't show up, seemingly after clearing fight response messages from the fight screen
  * The layout that the messages are being displayed on during fighting isn't big enough
  * Death doesn't happen
