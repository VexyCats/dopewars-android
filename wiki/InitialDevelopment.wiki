#summary To do list for initial development.

= Functional things =

  * customization
  * score reporting
  * resume in-progress game
  * user-created data (messages in the old version)

== Customization ==

Mostly done, just need to load new settings from a url.

== Score reporting ==

The score reporting server to start could just do mostly what the existing server does, just maintain a global score list by game type. Ultimately the goal is to include things like a "dealer of the day" and other superlatives, in addition to more of the custom messages that exist now.

== Resume in-progress game ==

This shouldn't be that hard, but will probably require an additional parameter with the game info about what style of game it is, and then just modify the title on the main screen to be Resume if that's available with like (hold for a new game) appended to the end.

== User-created data ==

I don't want to lose this. In fact it would be nice to expand it. One of the key old-school things was the songs, so it would be nice to expand that to user entry as well. And maybe the sayings could be a little more structured so they sound better in the game. What might be nice is to have responses somehow, maybe that's a future feature though. So for now I think I'll re-implement the random chance thing at the end of the game, ooo it can just be another button on the last screen if available, even.

= Visual things =

  * graphics
  * split the messages into fight & drug messages
  * make the messages disappear when they're tapped
  * make the messages more pop-up-video instead of the stack at the bottom
  * scrollable container for buttons
  * customizable ui, like text/image sizes (thinking about other phones)

== Scrollable container for buttons ==

In widescreen mode, or on other phones, the buttons might not all fit, so the container should be scrollable somehow to accommodate that.

= Code =

  * subfunctionize the makebutton code more
  * comments a-plenty
