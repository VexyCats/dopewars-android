#summary To do list for initial development.

= Big things =

  * Make inventory look good
  * Progress bar display problems
  * Loan shark
  * Bank
  * Big price change days
  * Guns & new coats
  * Officer hardass and his crew
  * Random messages
  * Graphics
  * Customization
  * Score reporting

= Loan shark details =

The loan shark amount should be pretty simple, and the bank account too, really, it'll be just another field in the game info, and get modified by dialogs just like the buy/sell drugs dialog. Super-easy, really.

= Bank details =

See loan shark details.

= Big price chnage days =

Shouldn't be too hard, just some new parameters on drugs and incorporating them into formulas.

= Random messages =

Really important, I haven't figured out how to handle it yet. Pop-up? Could be annoying. Scrolling marquee on the bottom? could be even worse waiting to read important info. Maybe random things could go in the background and more important things could come up front somehow?
