#summary To do list for initial development.

= Big things =

  * Make inventory look good
  * Progress bar display problems
  * Big price change days
  * Guns & new coats
  * End of game
  * Officer hardass and his crew
  * Random messages
  * Graphics
  * Customization
  * Score reporting

= Big price chnage days =

Shouldn't be too hard, just some new parameters on drugs and incorporating them into formulas.

= Guns & new coats =

Maybe have a random thing happen when moving locations and set that in the current game_info, like "new_coat_available" and "new_gun_available". On buying it's removed, on moving it's removed.

= Office hardass (and other cops) =

Hmm... dialog I guess? There can't be a way out though, but it'd be nice not to auto-kill when hitting back like I did in DW1. Maybe triggering an attack sets some game_info state, then every action checks that state before doing anything and re-opens the fight dialog. Sounds reasonable, assuming that check is pretty fast.

= Random messages =

Really important, I haven't figured out how to handle it yet. Pop-up? Could be annoying. Scrolling marquee on the bottom? could be even worse waiting to read important info. Maybe random things could go in the background and more important things could come up front somehow?
