#summary To do list for initial development.

= Functional things =

  * end of game
  * random messages
  * customization
  * score reporting

== Random (and other) messages ==

Really important, I haven't figured out how to handle it yet. Pop-up? Could be annoying. Scrolling marquee on the bottom? could be even worse waiting to read important info. Maybe random things could go in the background and more important things could come up front somehow?

Maybe a stacking list of messages from the bottom, that can be tapped to make them disappear? That's probably where I'll start.

== End of game ==

On the last page just put an 'end game' button that will enact all the score reporting features and head back to the main menu.

== Customization ==

Could parse xml or I could require that it be presented in the serialized format for the game information. One of the keys for customization is have a game key. The game key will have to be a public/private pair. The game key is used to encrypt score reports to the scoring server, which decrypts the score report.

This also includes the mechanism by which custom game parameters are loaded from within the game.

== Score reporting ==

The score reporting server to start could just do mostly what the existing server does, just maintain a global score list by game type. Ultimately the goal is to include things like a "dealer of the day" and other superlatives, in addition to more of the custom messages that exist now.

= Visual things =

  * inventory screen
  * progress bar display
  * graphics
  * orientation swapping
  * center all the buttons
  * display cash all the time
  * display space left on inventory/coat button
  * display the name somewhere? (is it needed?)

== Cash & space display ==

I wonder if it's necessary to have a name on the inventory button? then I could put the cash there, in like a human readable format (2 Mil) and then a more detailed view on the inventory screen (bam! done.).

= Code =

  * subfunctionize the makebutton code more
  * comments a-plenty
