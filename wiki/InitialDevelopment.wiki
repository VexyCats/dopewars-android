#summary To do list for initial development.

= Big things =

  * Make inventory look good
  * Progress bar display problems
  * End of game
  * Officer hardass and his crew
  * Random messages
  * Graphics
  * Customization
  * Score reporting
  * Orientation swap testing

= Office hardass (and other cops) =

Hmm... dialog I guess? There can't be a way out though, but it'd be nice not to auto-kill when hitting back like I did in DW1. Maybe triggering an attack sets some game_info state, then every action checks that state before doing anything and re-opens the fight dialog. Sounds reasonable, assuming that check is pretty fast.

= Random messages =

Really important, I haven't figured out how to handle it yet. Pop-up? Could be annoying. Scrolling marquee on the bottom? could be even worse waiting to read important info. Maybe random things could go in the background and more important things could come up front somehow?

= Littler things =

  * Display the space left on the inventory/coat button
  * Display current cash somewhere that's not a special bar at the bottom
  * Display the name somewhere that's not a special bar at the bottom
  * Lots of little code cleanup type things
